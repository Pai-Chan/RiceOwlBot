# RiceOwlBot
## Inspiration
In China, WeChat is the most popular app. One outstanding feature for its success is its numerous public accounts that provide info about a specific field. For an organization, different services can be synthesized and provided. This drives us to come up with an idea to build the official Rice public account that serves our students best. As the United States enjoyed not that many WeChat users, we decide to develop such a chat bot which can be deployed on various platforms which are familiar to the public in the US. Thus, an idea is come up to build a chat bot for Rice University students.
## What it does
Our owl bot is sensible. It can be serious and guides you to take classes. Or it can be humorous and talks about campus anecdotes.
## How it is built
This chat bot is built on a third-party platform named Meya. Flow controls are designed in YAML markup language. Data is manipulated from various APIs including GoogleMaps and Rice Open API. The business logic is realized in Python.
